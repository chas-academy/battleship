Learn about the game and what the rules are here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

All the code the functions that are needed are outlined in the JS-file. No need to add more unless you want to. Read the comments in the code *carefully*.

## Step 1: Get started by reading through the battleship.js file. All that you need to solve the assignment is described in comments

## Step 2: Use the for-loops defined in the code to generate a grid.

References for the methods in JS that are needed for this step:

- [document.getElementById()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
- [document.createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
- [appendChild()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)

- [How to loop in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

## Step 3: Attach event-listeners to each square in the grid and trigger the guess() function on click

## Step 4: Add the logic that's needed for the game to be playable
- [If-statments in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)

## Step 5: Play! Make sure you can win
A player should be able to sink all the ships, look in the js-file for the ship positions to make this easier to test.

BONUS tasks (optional):

- Add graphics, animation
- Add support for randomizing the grid
- Add support for resetting the game without having to reload the webpage
